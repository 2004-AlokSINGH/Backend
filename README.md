### About This Repository

Welcome to the **Backend Projects Repository**! ðŸš€

This repository is a collection of various backend projects developed using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). Each project showcases different backend concepts, functionalities, and patterns, aimed at building efficient, scalable, and secure server-side applications. These projects serve as hands-on examples for learning and experimenting with modern web development using MERN.

### Tech Stack:
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for managing structured and unstructured data.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js to build APIs and server-side logic.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment to build fast, scalable network applications.
- **React.js**: While the primary focus is on backend development, some projects may include minimal frontend to test API functionality.

### Projects Included:
1. **User Authentication System**: JWT-based authentication, password hashing, and role-based access control.
2. **RESTful API for E-Commerce**: CRUD operations, product management, user profiles, shopping cart functionality.
3. **Real-time Tracking**: WebSocket integration for real-time tracking between users.
4. **Chess Game**: Chess game using WebSocket and chess.js.
5. **Blog Platform Backend**: Creating and managing articles, categories, tags, and user comments.
6. **Task Management System**: Project, task, and team member management with real-time updates.
   
### Key Features:
- **Database Integration**: Efficient data handling with MongoDB and Mongoose ORM.
- **Security**: JWT authentication, password encryption (bcrypt), and validation to prevent common security issues.
- **Error Handling & Logging**: Proper error management and logging for easier debugging and maintenance.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Clean, modular codebase that follows best practices for scalable and maintainable backend services.
- **Testing**: Some projects may include unit and integration tests using Jest or Mocha for ensuring reliability.

### Getting Started:
Each project is structured independently with its own README, detailing the setup, environment variables, and instructions for running the project. The general process to get started with a project is:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Set up environment variables as per the `.env.example` file.
5. Run the application using `npm start`.
